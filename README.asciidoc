Docmake is an automated builder from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook[DocBook/XML] to its output formats (e.g XHTML5 or PDF).
It aims to be a saner replacement for https://pagure.io/xmlto/[xmlto].

( Note that xmlto's development has stagnated somewhat right before the
release of the first version of docmake. )
